Installing Rails and PHP

Ruby on Rails

You will need to have a recent version of Ruby, like 2.5.0 or 2.5.1 and Rails 5.2 installed on your development environment in order to be able to follow along with this course.

We recommend that you use either a Mac, Linux, or cloud-based IDE for your development environment for this course.

For Mac, please make sure that you are not using the default system Ruby that comes already installed on the Mac

 The install instructions for Ruby on Rails are available here http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-mac.html

For Ubuntu Linux, the install instructions for Ruby on Rails are available here http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-ubuntu.html

If you are on Windows, we recommend you try out a cloud based IDE such as Cloud 9 (https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/). Please contact the instructors if you are interested in signing up for an account.

If you want to install Ruby on Rails locally on Windows (which we don't recommend) you can try using the following instructions http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/installing-rails-5-windows

You can run the Rails server with

rails s

from the command line in the root directory of your Rails app after running bundle install

PHP

Mac OSX already comes with PHP http://php.net/manual/en/install.macosx.bundled.php

Windows http://php.net/manual/en/install.windows.php

Unix/Linux http://php.net/manual/en/install.unix.php



To start the PHP development server running locally, use this command

php -S localhost:8000

from the root directory of the application

Other

I also recommend a modern web browser such as Google Chrome to preview your applications from http://localhost:8000 for PHP and http://localhost:3000 for Ruby on Rails
